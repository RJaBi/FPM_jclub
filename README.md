# jclub

A Repository to demonstrate usage of the fortran-package manager and the meson-build system for a journal club in the school of mathematics, trinity college dublin.

As I am a lattice gauge theorist, that is the examples I am using.

In particular, I have implemented the plaquette measurement and also the anisotropy and lattice spacing measurement using the Wilson flow.
